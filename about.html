                <p>Hello there! l'm a 2nd-year Computer Science undergraduate at the Informatics Institute of
                    Technology (IT) in Sri Lanka, affliated with the University of Westminster, UK, specializing in Fullstack development and mobile/desktop
                    application design and development. Alongside my studies, I actively work as a professional footballer.
                     </p>
                    
                    
                   <p> My interest in technology started because I was passionate about solving problems and wanted to make the designs I saw in everyday digital interfaces, apps, and websites better. This enthusiasm eventually developed into a distinct goal: to create dependable, approachable software with slick, contemporary UI/UX elements that appeal to consumers. I enjoy creating solutions that not only work well but also provide smooth, interesting user experiences that make technology seem simple and approachable.  Beyond academics, I enjoy playing football and exploring fragrances, I love listening to Pop, rap music, and EDM, which keeps me motivated and upbeat. Watching movies,TV
                    series, as well well as as reading comic books, fuel my curiosity and keeps
                    me open to new perspectives. I also enjoy making memes on social media  browsing YouTube for tutorials and insights on tech and design. These varied interests often spark ideas for creative design and user-centered
                    features in my projects, giving me fresh insights into how digital and real-worid environments blend to shape meaningful interactions.These diverse interests frequently inspire concepts for innovative design and user-centred elements in my work, providing me with new perspectives on how real-world and digital environments interact to create meaningful experiences.</p><a href="https://aboutme.com" class="underline-link">Read more..</a>
